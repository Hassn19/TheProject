# 🧠 Machine Learning Pipeline – End-to-End ML Project

Welcome to **TheProject**, an end-to-end machine learning pipeline built using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. This project walks through all stages of an ML workflow—from data loading and cleaning, to training, evaluation, and generating predictions.

Whether you're a data enthusiast, student, or recruiter, this repository showcases clear, modular work suitable for real-world deployment or further experimentation.

## 📖 Overview

This project focuses on:
- Cleaning and preparing structured data
- Building supervised ML models
- Comparing model performance using evaluation metrics
- Making predictions on unseen/test data

It demonstrates modular development using multiple Jupyter notebooks, ideal for testing, debugging, and versioning various stages of the pipeline.

## ⚙️ Installation

You’ll need Python 3.8+ and Jupyter installed. Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hassn19/TheProject.git
cd TheProject
pip install -r requirements.txt

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn joblib

jupyter notebook

Run the notebooks in the following order:

0.0 Loading Data.ipynb

0.1 Data Preprocessing.ipynb

0.2 Data Splitting.ipynb

1.0 Model Training.ipynb

1.1 Model Testing.ipynb

2.0 Predictions.ipynb

Or run 3.0 Final.ipynb to execute the entire workflow in one go.

These models are trained and compared during the project. You can easily extend this list.

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Decision Tree

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Gradient Boosting (optional)

Hyperparameters can be tuned using GridSearchCV or similar techniques for improved performance.

Evaluation metrics used:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1 Score

Confusion Matrix

These are reported and visualized in 1.1 Model Testing.ipynb.
